## Projects

### Project 1: Displaying data using tables
In this project we were tasked with using NHTS and NGSIM data to understand driving behavior and transportation system performance. We were tasked with organizing and displaying data to visualize the trends within the given data. My group and I used this data and imported it through the python software which we imported the panda, matplotlib, and seaborn packages to help us obtain our data. This project tought us a lot about how to visualize our data and to perform and execute tasks to organize and make sure everything is displayed correctly
